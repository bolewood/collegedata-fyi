## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Load and analyze IPEDS endowment values, gifts, investment returns, spending distributions, and other changes from official Finance releases.
- Request endowment facts from the per-school public API with the `finance` category.

### Changed

- Resolve Finance table names by fiscal year and preserve manifest-declared release provenance throughout downloads, analysis, and loads.
- Make release reruns revision-safe by rejecting downgrades and rollbacks, pruning stale rows and facts, and superseding older public facts.

### Fixed

- Route revised-final Finance data through the official Access database, reject zero-fact endowment runs, and prevent stale sibling artifacts from being loaded.
- Bound and stream Access archive downloads, and reject unsupported Finance comparison filters instead of returning unrelated default columns.
